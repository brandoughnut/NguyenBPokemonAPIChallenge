Peer Review Comments: Website looks nice and functions as should. I like the minimal approach and the changing background color. The evolution section is done nicely as well.

## Here are a couple of critiques but nothing major stands out:
    + Could add a hover effect over the evolution images so the user knows that its clickable 
    + Same thing for when you click the main image to get it to be shiny
    + The location found text could use some processing to remove the '-' and capitalize the location 
    + Nit picky but the desgin choice to have ability box be so big is a little overkill since most pokemon only have 2-4 ablilites.
